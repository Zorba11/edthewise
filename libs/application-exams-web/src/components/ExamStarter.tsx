                Greetings, seeker of knowledge! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú® I am EdTheWise, your guide through the labyrinth of learning. Allow
                me to lead you on a journey through the annals of previous years' questions. Follow these ancient steps,
                and you shall find wisdom:

                <span>Sow Seeds of Answering: </span>
                For each question, four paths shall be laid before you. Choose with wisdom and mark the one that
                resonates with truth. Should doubts cloud your vision, ask, and I shall illuminate the way.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                <span>Journey's End and Reflection: </span>
                Upon completing your chosen path, click 'Submit.' Reflect upon your answers, for therein lies learning.
                I shall present you with a mirror of understanding, showing you the answers and the wisdom you have
                gained.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                <span>Embrace Continuous Learning: </span>
                Each trial through these ancient questions is a step toward mastery. Return often, explore new paths,
                and seek my counsel whenever you wish.
